## About

This is a guide outlining how to set up and execute [ONTvisc pipeline](https://github.com/eresearchqut/ontvisc) on three on three Australian high-performance computing systems: [Lyra (QUT)](https://eresearchqut.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EG/pages/1545143157/Start+using+the+HPC), [Gadi (NCI)](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Gadi+User+Guide) and [Setonix (Pawsey)](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Setonix+User+Guide).

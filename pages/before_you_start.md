## Access to the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service

## Other prerequisites
ONTViSc is a pipeline written in Nextflow; thus, a basic knowledge of this workflow orchestration engine is required. In addition, you need to know how to use a command line - create directories, navigate between the folders, execute commands, etc. It may be useful for launching the Tower Agent to enable Australian Nextflow Seqera Service or when the pipeline needs troubleshooting.
